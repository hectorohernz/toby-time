## How to get started.
1. Clone Repository with the command __git clone https://github.com/hectorohernz/toby-time.git__ 
2. Now just launch a development local Server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages. Ex: Live Server ( Vs Code ).
3. Congrats that is Toby Time ! 



## Story Behind This Project 
I love assigning myself projects when learning something new. This was one of my first projects while learning Javascript, I have never programmed before in my life, so this was pretty huge during that week. Now I'm pretty knowledgable with programming.
